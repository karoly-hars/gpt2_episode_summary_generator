# Generating TV show episode summaries with GPT-2

With the code in this repo, it is possible to scrape IMDb and Wikipedia to acquire a large number of episode 
summaries for a TV show, and to use the data to train a GPT-2 model to generate similar summaries. Due to the lack of 
large-scale datasets, the generated summaries are usually far from perfect, but they are grammatically correct thanks to
the pre-training of the GPT-2 networks. Also, as expected, they usually quite funny :grin:.


## Requirements
To code was written/tested using python3 and the following packages:
- torch 1.3.1
- Beautifulsoup 4.8.0
- pytorch_transformers 1.2.0
- Scrapy 1.8.0

(plus their prerequisites)


## How-To
Clone the repo and install the required packages.


### Running the Scrapy spiders/crawlers

##### IMDb spider
Running the IMDb spider is fairly simple. It only takes a set of keywords as input params: 

Examples:
- ```python3 run_imdb_spider.py --title_keywords game of thrones -o got_imdb.json```
- ```python3 run_imdb_spider.py --title_keywords rupaul\'s drag race -o rupauls_drag_race_imdb.json```
- ```python3 run_imdb_spider.py --title_keywords south park -o south_park_imdb.json```
- ```python3 run_imdb_spider.py --title_keywords star trek -o star_trek_imdb.json```
- ```python3 run_imdb_spider.py --title_keywords walker texas ranger -o walker_imdb.json```
- ```python3 run_imdb_spider.py --title_keywords charmed -o charmed_imdb.json```

##### Wikipedia spider
The Wiki spider is slightly more complicated than the previous one. The user have to provide a starting page 
for the recursive search in Wikipedia, a string that will be used to filter out URLs 
(URLs that do not contain the string will be skipped), and a list of keywords to filter out additional 
pages based the title of the Wikipedia article.

Examples:
- ```python3 run_wiki_spider.py --start_url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones --title_keywords game thrones --url_substring Game_of_Thrones -o got_wiki.json```
- ```python3 run_wiki_spider.py --start_url "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race" --title_keywords rupaul drag race --url_substring "RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race" -o rupauls_drag_race_wiki.json```
- ```python3 run_wiki_spider.py --start_url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park --title_keywords south park --url_substring South_Park -o south_park_wiki.json```
- ```python3 run_wiki_spider.py --start_url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek --title_keywords star trek --url_substring Star_Trek -o star_trek_wiki.json```
- ```python3 run_wiki_spider.py --start_url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker,_Texas_Ranger --title_keywords walker texas ranger --url_substring Walker,_Texas_Ranger -o walker_wiki.json```
- ```python3 run_wiki_spider.py --start_url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmed --title_keywords charmed --url_substring Charmed -o charmed_wiki.json```

---

In general, it is probably a good idea to choose TV shows or franchises with at least 100-150 episodes,
otherwise we might end up with subpar results.

After the spiders are finished, take a quick look into the output JSON files and verify that they contain the right data.

For additional information, check ```python3 run_imdb_spider -h``` and ```python3 run_wiki_spider -h```.

##### Pre-scapred episode data
I ran the spiders for some TV shows to provide an opportunity for users to train a network without running the spiders first.
The data can be found in ```./scraped_data/```.


### Training the network
Call the script ```train.py``` to train a GPT-2 network. 

For example:

```
python3 train.py -j scraped_data/star_trek_wiki.json scraped_data/star_trek_imdb.json
```

The script splits the data into a training and validation subset. 
During the training, there is a checkpoint at every X step. At these checkpoints, the loss on 
the validation subset is calculated and a few samples are generated for the user to further monitor the progress.
The best model from the training is saved during the process.

Multi-GPU training is currently not implemented.

For more information, check ```python3 train.py -h```.


### Generating episode summaries from scratch
After you have a trained model, you can generate episodes with:

```
python3 generate.py --num_samples <NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES_TO_GENERATE> --random_seed <SEED>
```


If you want to play around with other parameters of the generation process, check ```python3 generate.py -h```.

If you changed the GPT-2 model size (```--gpt2_size```) from the default ```'gpt2'``` in the training, you will also have to change it for the generation.
